# **Working with IBM provided guest images**

## **Pre-requisites**

1. If you are going to use the command line (CLI) tools, ensure you have openstack GlanceClient installed. You can find installation instructions our knowledge base: **Getting started with the OpenStack API**

2. Ensure you have access to the BoxPanel to be get the temporary download urls for the IBM provided guest images.

## **Basic concepts**
Item | Description
------------ | -------------
Images | A virtual machine image, referred to in this document simply as an image, is a single file that contains a virtual disk with a bootable operating system installed on it. Use images to create virtual machine instances within the cloud.
Instances | Instances are virtual machines that run inside the Openstack  cloud.
Flavor | Flavor is used to describe an instance size and defines the pre-determined resource specifications for amount of vCPU, RAM and disk space.

## **1. Image Catalog**
#### **1.1 IBM provided guest images**
Client may upload and install separately acquired operating system software or Client may provision the following available operating system images with a virtual machine instance.  Client is responsible to comply with applicable operating system license terms and to acquire proper entitlements for each virtual machine instance.

* CentOS 6.7 x86_64
* CentOS 7.2 x86_64
* Ubuntu Server 12.04 LTS x86_64
* Ubuntu Server 14.04 LTS x86_64
* Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 Datacenter
* Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 Enterprise
* Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 Standard
* Windows Server 2012 R2 Datacenter
* Windows Server 2012 R2 Standard

For any Microsoft Windows operating system virtual computing instances Client provisions, Client is required to have and maintain Clientâ€™s own Microsoft Windows License server for activating such Windows operating system virtual computing instances. Please refer to this about [**How to activate Windows licenses in IBM BlueBox Cloud.**](Windows_License_Activation.md "How to activate Windows licenses in IBM BlueBox Cloud")


## **2. Download images**
#### **2.1 Download .qcow2 & .md5sum files of the image**
**Get image download url from BoxPanel**
1. Log into BoxPanel with BoxPanel credentials and navigate to the page for **<TBD>"Guest Images Download"**
2. Click on **<TBD>"Get Download URL"** for interested image
3. The tempURLs will be displayed that will be valid for next 24hrs to download the guest image.

**Download** the .qcow2 image file & .md5sum checksum file using the tempURL and put these 2 files under the same folder.

For example:
```
ubuntu-guest-image-14.04-20160301-x86_64.qcow2
ubuntu-guest-image-14.04-20160301-x86_64.md5sum
```

#### **2.2 Verify the downloaded .qcow2 image file using the .md5sum checksum file**
For example:
```
# md5sum -c ubuntu-guest-image-14.04-20160301-x86_64.md5sum
ubuntu-guest-image-14.04-20160301-x86_64.qcow2: OK
```
If the result returns "OK", the downloaded qcow2 image is valid.


## **3. Upload image to IBM BlueBox Cloud glance repository**

#### **3.1 Upload image to Glance using Openstack Dashboard**
1. Login to IBM BlueBox Cloud Openstack dashboard
2. Under the **Project** panel, expand **Compute** and click **Images**.
3. Click **"Create Image"** in the page. Specify the following parameters in the new page:

```
4. Click **"Create Image"**.  
Check the created image is in image list. The image is queued for upload. It might take some time before the status changes from "Queued" to "Active".

#### **3.2 Upload image to Glance using Openstack Command Line Client**
You can upload images through the Glance client. [Installing Openstack Clients](http://docs.openstack.org/cli-reference/common/cli_install_openstack_command_line_clients.html)
* **Create image**  
    For Linux Images, use "-- min-disk 5 --min-ram 512"  
    For Windows Images, use "--min-disk 25 --min-ram 2048"
    ```
    # glance --os-image-api-version 1 image-create --name <image_name> --min-disk 5 --min-ram 512 --disk-format qcow2 --container-format bare --is-public True --file <path_to_qcow2_image_file>
    ```

* **Check if the image is created successfully**  
    The image is queued for upload. It might take some time before the status changes from "Queued" to "Active".
    ```
    # glance image-show <image-id>
    ```


## **4. Create VM instances using uploaded images**

#### **4.1 Create VM instance using Openstack Dashboard**
1. Login to IBM BlueBox Cloud Openstack dashboard
2. Expand the Project and Compute sections in the navigation area and select Images. The dashboard shows the images that have been uploaded to Openstack Glance repository and are available for this project.
3. Select an image and click **Launch**.
4. In the Launch Instance dialog box, specify field values in the **Details**, **Access & Security**, **Networking**, and **Post-Creation** tabs. For more details about these fields, see the following tables.
5. Click **"Launch"**

Then you will see the newly created instance in your instances list. The instance is queued for creation. It might take some time before the status changes from "Build" to "Active".

**Details tab**

Field | Description
------------ | -------------
Availability Zone | Select an availability zone for your instance. There is currently only one available: nova.
Instance Name | Assign a name to the virtual machine. Note: The name that you assign here becomes the initial host name of the server. After the server is built, changes to this name are not updated in the dashboard (if you change the server name in the API or if you change the host name directly). Server names are not guaranteed to be unique when created so you could have two instances with the same host name.
Flavor | Specify the size of the instance to launch.
Instance Count | To launch multiple instances, enter a value greater than 1. The default is 1.
Instance Boot Source | Since you are launching an instance from an image, Boot from image is chosen by default.	   
Image Name | This field changes based on your previous selection. Since you have chosen to launch an instance using an image, the Image Name field displays with the name of the image you selected.	 


**Access & Security tab**
Field | Description
------------ | -------------
Key pair | Specify a key pair. If no key pairs are available you can upload a new public key by clicking the + sign next to the dropdown box and pasting in your ssh-rsa public key.
Security Groups | Activate the security groups that you want to assign to the instance. Security groups are a kind of cloud firewall that define which incoming network traffic is forwarded to instances. If you have not created any security groups, you can assign only the default security group to the instance. If you want your instances to be accessible by ping or SSH, your can create unlocked security groups.

**Networking tab**
Field | Description
------------ | -------------
Selected Networks | To add a network to the instance, click the + in the Available Networks field.

**Post-Creation tab**
Field | Description
------------ | -------------
Customization Script | Specify a customization script that runs after your instance is launched.

* **For Linux instances:**  
To enable password authentication in console and ssh, use the following script data for the Customization Script (with the relevant password in place of _<YOUR_PASSWORD>_):
    ```
    #cloud-config
    password: <YOUR_PASSWORD>
    chpasswd: { expire: False }
    ssh_pwauth: True
    ```

* **For Windows instances:**  
To set the initial username and password, use the following script data for the Customization Script (with the relevant username and password in place of _<YOUR_USERNAME>_ and _<YOUR_PASSWORD>_).

    ```
    rem cmd
    net user <YOUR_USERNAME> <YOUR_PASSWORD> /logonpasswordchg:yes /add /y
    net localgroup administrators <YOUR_USERNAME> /add
    ```

#### **4.2 Connecting to your instance**
1. Login to IBM BlueBox Cloud Openstack dashboard
2. Expand the Project panel, then the Compute tab in the left navigation area and click on Instances.
3. Locate your instance in the list of running instances and note its IP address, such as 192.168.100.237.
4. Create a connection to your instance specifying its IP address.

* **For Linux instances**  
Connect to your instance through SSH or VNC. The default userid for the Linux images provided by IBM is **ibmcloud**. Once connected to your Linux instance, you can use the sudo command to execute commands that normally require root access. Sudo is configured to not require a password for the default userid.

  * Use your favorite SSH client and open a connection to the right IP address of the VM instance using the private SSH key of the keypair that you specified during provisioning:  
    ```
    # ssh -i <path_of_Your_SSH_private_key_file> <userid>@<ip_of_instance>
    ```
    **Note:** The default userid for the Linux images provided by IBM is **ibmcloud**.

  * View the VNC console of the instance by clicking on the instance name in IBM BlueBox Cloud Openstack dashboard, and then click on the **console** tab. The VNC console connects you with HTTPS. To be able to log in via the console to a new Linux instance as **ibmcloud** user, you must have specified a password in the Customization Script during provisioning.

* **For Windows instances**  
Connect to your instance through Remote Desktop or VNC. You need to use the userid and password specified in the Customization Script during VM provisioning. On your first login, a prompt displays requesting that you change your password.

  * Use your favorite Remote Desktop client to connect.
  * View the VNC console of the instance by clicking on the instance name in IBM BlueBox Cloud Openstack dashboard, and then click on the **console** tab. The VNC console connects you with HTTPS.

## **5. Image update**
When there is a notification from BlueBox operations that guest images are updated, you can deactivate the existing image and re-create a new image using the download url got from BoxPanel for the updated image.
Using Openstack Command Line Client to deactivate the existing image
1. Get the existing image id
    ```
    # glance image-list
    ```

2. Deactivate the image
    ```
    # glance image-deactivate <image_id>
    ```

4. Show the image status
    ```
    # glance image-show <image_id>
    ```

5. After deactivated the existing image, please re-create the new image by following the steps of **[3. Upload image to IBM BlueBox Cloud glance repository]** in this guide.


## **6. Get support from BlueBox operations regarding guest images**

When there is a need to get support from BlueBox operations regarding a specific guest image, it will help if the **buildID** of the image can be provided. Please get the buildID of the image as follows, and then raise support ticket to BlueBox operations and mention the buildID.
* **From the image file name:**  
    e.g. ubuntu-guest-image-14.04-20160301-x86_64.qcow2
* **From the buildID file in guest VM provisioned from the image:**

    * For **Linux** instances:  
    The buildID file will be located at: **/etc/buildID**

    * For **Windows** instances:  
    The buildID file will be located at: **C:\buildID**
