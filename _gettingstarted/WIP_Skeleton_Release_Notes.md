#### **HIPAA and IBM Blue Box Local Cloud**

	• You can select HIPAA Enablement for your IBM Blue Box Local Cloud

A HIPAA-enabled cloud has the same configuration and expansion options as any other IBM Blue Box Cloud offering, but we are enabling _over 50 additional information-security controls_ that support our customers who must store personal health information (PHI). Because of this increased information security capability, a HIPAA-enabled cloud must be HIPAA-enabled from its inception: you cannot upgrade an existing cloud to enable HIPAA protocol. Also, you cannot downgrade from an IBM Blue Box Local HIPAA cloud: the existing HIPAA cloud must be wiped—per HIPAA protocol—and you must order a new Local cloud with non-HIPAA controllers.
