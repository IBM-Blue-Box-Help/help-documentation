### Q. Why can't I delete a security group?

A. It might be in use by a port. You'll need to delete the port. If the port is in use by, for example, a load balancer, you'll need to delete the load balancer before deleting the group.

Here are some example cleanup commands for your LBaaS:

```
neutron lbaas-pool-list | grep True | awk '{print $2}' |xargs -i neutron 
lbaas-pool-delete {} 
neutron lbaas-listener-list | grep True | awk '{print $2}' |xargs -i 
neutron lbaas-listener-delete {} 
neutron lbaas-loadbalancer-list | grep ACTIVE | awk '{print $2}' |xargs -i 
neutron lbaas-loadbalancer-delete {} 
```

With the following commands, you can find and delete a port that might be in use:
```
neutron port-list
neutron port-delete PORT
```

where PORT is the ID of the port that is in use by the security group you want to delete.
