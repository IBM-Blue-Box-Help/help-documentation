### General Product Overview

Both offerings of **IBM Bluemix Private Cloud**, Dedicated and Local, are deployed automatically through a **Site Controller** machine, which serves as a storehouse for the **Ursula/Ansible playbooks** we use to create your cloud. You can view the [Ursula playbooks](https://github.com/blueboxgroup/ursula) on **GitHub**. They are open source documents.

**Site Controller**

To deploy the **IBM Bluemix Private Cloud** offering, a physical **Site Controller** machine must be located in an **IBM Cloud Data Center** within the same geographical region in which your new Bluemix Private cloud is deployed.

To deploy the **IBM Bluemix Private Cloud Local** offering, a Site Controller logical machine must be co-located within your IBM Local Cloud data center, and it will communicate with a Central Site Controller machine at your IBM Cloud Data Center.

Each version of **Ursula** on the Site Controller is tailored to initialize and run a specific version of OpenStack and IBM Bluemix Private Cloud, by setting up the proper environment variables and other aspects of your customized cloud configuration. The particular version of Ursula described in this document is 3.0.0, and the environment which it creates for your cloud is described in the next section.

**Software Environment Created by Ursula**

IBM Bluemix Private Cloud software is based on **Ubuntu 14.04** or ** ** and the **Mitaka** or **Newton** release of OpenStack, specifically including the Nova, Glance (backend points to Swift), Swift, Cinder (backed by Ceph clusters), Neutron L3 HA, Neutron LBaaS v2, Keystone, Horizon, Heat, LBaaS, and Ceilometer (+MongoDB) modules. The Cinder backing data storage is provided by Ceph clusters. Your cloud also will include some third-party software monitoring tools that work along with the OpenStack modules: Grafana, ELK, and Sensu.

Upon request, IBM will enable some additional enhanced features:

* OpenStack software load balancer (LBaaS) that is managed through Neutron (it requires the Dedicated Controller feature)
* VLAN support for spanning between clouds
* Integration with Urban Code Deployer (UCD) through an OpenStack Heat (Orchestration) plug-in.

**Hardware Environment and Monitoring**

The IBM Bluemix Private Cloud hardware substrate varies by offering. You can get more information about the Bill of Materials (BOM) from your IBM Bluemix Private Cloud service team.

You can use the **OpenStack Horizon** interface to monitor your cloudâ€™s performance, or you can use our customized product, **Box Panel**, to view your cloud as well as your resource usage, your network configurations, and other features of your cloud.

You can find more information about how to use Box Panel in the [Box Panel User Guide.](http://ibm-blue-box-help.github.io/help-documentation/gettingstarted/userguides/Box_Panel/)

**Support**

Your purchase of IBM Bluemix Private Cloud includes 24/7 technical support. The Box Panel product provides an interface for opening a support ticket. You also can call Bluemix Private Cloud Support at 1-800-613-4305 or email us at *support@bluebox.net*.
