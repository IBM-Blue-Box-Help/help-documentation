Q. How can I route internal traffic between projects (tenants)?

A. Your Blue Box Cloud environment includes a pre-provisioned network called "internal" and a pre-provisioned router called "default" attached to that network. These two resources are shared across all tenants. If you require further customization, or need help attaching specific tenant networks to one particular router, please let us know.
