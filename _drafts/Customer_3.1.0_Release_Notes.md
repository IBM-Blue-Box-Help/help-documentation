## Release Notes 3.1.0

#### October 14, 2016


This document offers a basic description of the 3.1.0 Dedicated and Local Cloud offerings. Links to further documentation can be found in each section.

### Summary of the Latest Release

Release 3.1.0 of **IBM Blue Box Cloud, Dedicated and Local**, includes some new capabilities and performance improvements. It is still based on the OpenStack Mitaka release.

**Every IBM Blue Box 3.1.0 Cloud has these new features:**

1.) **Federated Keystoneâ€“Customer Identity Provider (IdP)**: Customers now can utilize their existing Identity Infrastructure federation protocols, such as Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) or OpenIDConnect, to use the identities stored in their own identity directories (such as LDAP, RADIUS, and Active Directory). A single, customer-managed credential can be used to manage multiple OpenStack clouds.

*Here are some related documents:*

 * [K2K Federation](http://ibm-blue-box-help.github.io/help-documentation/keystone/k2k-federation/)
 * [SAML Federation](http://ibm-blue-box-help.github.io/help-documentation/keystone/saml-federation/)
 * [OIDC Federation](http://ibm-blue-box-help.github.io/help-documentation/keystone/oidc-federation/)       

2.) **Storage Pools**: Customers with diverse storage performance requirements can now direct workloads optimally, to high-performance SSD and cost-effective Hybrid storage pools in the same cloud. The minimum number of OSD nodes for a new deployment remains at 3, and for hybrid expansion a minumum of 3 nodes must be added. After that, you may expand your storage one node at a time.

*Here are some related documents:*

 * [Supported volume types](http://ibm-blue-box-help.github.io/help-documentation/cinder/supported_volume_types/) 
 * [Creating a volume from Horizon](http://ibm-blue-box-help.github.io/help-documentation/horizon/create-volume-from-horizon/)
 * [Creating a volume from the command line](http://ibm-blue-box-help.github.io/help-documentation/cinder/cli-create-volume/)

3.) **Storage Performance Improvements**: **Ceph** deployments have been upgraded to the Jewel release with Jemalloc enabled, to provide a performance improvement.


**IBM Blue Box Cloud Image Updates**

**An update for IBM Blue Box Cloud Images**: Our library of available Cloud Images has been updated. The [Cloud Image User Guide]( http://ibm-blue-box-help.github.io/help-documentation/gettingstarted/userguides/cloud_images/image_patch_list_20160910/Image_Release_Notes_2016-09-10/) has the latest information. 

**IBM Blue Box 3.1.0 Dedicated Cloud features:**

 * Blue Box Dedicated is now ISO27001 and 270018 compliant, plus SOC 2 and 3.

**IBM Blue Box 3.1.0 Local Cloud features:**

 * **Support for Lenovo**: In addition to the current Cisco UCS platform, a Lenovo-curated bill of materials is now supported.  
 * **Support for Bluemix Local System**: IBM Blue Box Local (PCaaS) Private Cloud as a Service is now supported on Bluemix Local Systems.

### Known Limitations of this Release

On Horizon, Federated users have a page on which they can change their password. An error occurs when
attempting to change the password, because their identity information is not stored. (Defect #236958)

On Horizon, a user with `project_admin` access granted through groups may not see any users in **Identity->Projects**. (Defect #237038)
