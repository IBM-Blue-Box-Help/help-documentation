Transferring a domain name can be a complicated process and is often getting more and more complicated as time goes on. Other Registrars (where you've registered your domain) don't want to see you leave, so they figure that if they make this process as complicated as humanly possible, maybe you'll stay.

There are several registrars that will take care of all of this for you, for example: hover.com

Below we will outline the steps involved to transfer a domain. These steps may change, and if/when they do, we'll be sure to update this process, but here's the best outline for how this process presently works.

    The first step is to login to your existing domain registrar and make these changes / collect this information:
        Turn off Domain Protection or Domain Locking
        Turn off Domain Privacy / WHOIS Privacy
        Make sure all email contact details are presently up to date
        See if you can locate the authorization code
    Once you have those pieces of information, contact us and ask to initiate the transfer.
    We will initiate the request with our registration provider, TuCows / OpenSRS.
    TuCows will send the request to where the domain is presently registered.
    From this step, you should receive 2 emails. The first should be from TuCows / OpenSRS asking you to confirm the transfer. You'll need to follow the instructions they send in that email to authorize the transfer. This step is very important. If you do not authorize the transfer here, the transfer will time out and we will have to re-initiate the transfer.
    Once you've approved the transfer within TuCows / OpenSRS, you will then get another email from your existing registrar asking you to authorize the move. You need to make sure to authorize this request as well.
    Assuming all the steps above were a success, the domain should transfer within a few days.

### A Few Notes

This process can take as long as 3 weeks assuming everything goes right. You'll want to make sure you start the process early enough before your domain expires so you don't run into any problems.
