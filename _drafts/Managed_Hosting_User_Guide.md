### Welcome to the IBM Blue Box Managed Hosting User Guide

This document offers a way for our Blue Box Managed Hosting customers to find information they need as they are migrating to other cloud service providers.

To learn how to get the latest Blue Box status updates, including information about maintenance windows, visit the [Blue Box Status Pages](http://ibm-blue-box-help.github.io/help-documentation/gettingstarted/commonadmin/status-pages/.

To learn how to transfer your domain name from Blue Box to your new cloud service provider, please visit our article on that topic, [here](https://github.com/IBM-Blue-Box-Help/help-documentation/blob/gh-pages/_drafts/Transferring_A_Domain_From_Blue_Box.md).

Best wishes to you from the IBM Blue Box support team.
